# Digit_Recognizer

## About
This classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

### Goal

The goal of the project is to correctly classify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images

### Additional Tasks Performed

I have written the digits manually using a paint and few online tools, and tested the model on the images
